Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using printf.

Input Format

Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of  alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from  to .

Output Format

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly  characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

Explanation

Each String is left-justified with trailing whitespace through the first 15 characters. The leading digit of the integer is the  16character, and each integer that was less than 3  digits now has leading zeroes.

            for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
                String s1=sc.next();
                int x=sc.nextInt();
               
                  
                System.out.printf("%-15s%03d\n" ,s1 , x);// %-15s: genrally strings are right justified so to make it left justified we used -15 infront of %s 
                // to restric the no of intgers we used 3 & to add zero in case of 2\1 digit no we added 0 infront of %d 
            }
            System.out.println("================================");
    }
}
